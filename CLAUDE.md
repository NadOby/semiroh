# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI sessions working on SHEAR. Read this first; read the docs it
points to only when the task touches them.

## What this is

SHEAR is the skeleton of a systems programming language whose canonical
program is an immutable semantic graph, and whose programs carry their own
compiler and can modify themselves at runtime (Erlang-style hot loading in
spirit). `shear/` is an executable Python *reference model* of the semantic
rules, not the language implementation. `README.md` is the overview; `docs/`
holds one spec per concept; `CHANGES.md` is the architectural log.

## Vision (guidance, not dogma)

- The semantic graph is the source of truth. It generalizes a hypergraph:
  there are no nodes and edges, only entities; a relation is an entity.
- Semantic state is immutable. Changes produce new states; identity never
  depends on history or provenance.
- Runtime is an interpretation of semantic state. Runtime mutation (cell
  content) never changes semantic identity.
- Transformations are explicit: continuity, disappearance, creation, splits,
  merges, conversions. Ambiguity is rejected, never silently resolved.
- Constraints are semantic values; executable evaluators are separate and
  referenced by name.
- Be pragmatic, not pure: prefer the smallest change that works, defer design
  decisions until a real program needs them, and change the vision where it
  contradicts reality.
- Spend cheap implementation on evidence, not on accumulated code. When
  bounded competing implementations can settle an architectural question,
  prefer the experiment to argument, but fix the discriminator and the
  predictions before building them and name what would falsify the current
  design; a revision is recorded with its reason before the rerun.

## Workflow

- Work follows `docs/roadmap.md`: its task order, and the five task roles
  its Workflow section defines: Plan, Execute, Review, Resolve and Publish.
  "Plan task N", "Execute task N", "Review task N", "Resolve task N" and
  "Publish task N" are sufficient instructions, because the roadmap defines
  each role's contract; read it when given one.
- Plan, Execute and Review normally run in separate fresh chats. The context
  or model that implemented a change is never its sole certifier: Review is
  independent of Execute, and fixes for its findings belong to Resolve, not
  to Review. A different model family can add independence but is optional;
  role separation and fresh context are mandatory.
- No background agents.
- No role may assume write access to GitHub or the repository. A role without
  it delivers its output in its reply (findings, `handoff.md` text, issue or
  PR text) for the owner or a write-capable role to record, and never says
  something is recorded, opened or pushed unless it checked.
- Work is tracked in GitHub issues: every roadmap task and every other change
  has an issue before work starts, and a follow-up found while working becomes
  a `follow-up` issue, not a note in a file or a chat. The roadmap's Workflow
  section says how the roles use them.
- `handoff.md` is a compact checkpoint of state and claims (task, role,
  decisions, next steps), not a log, not an authority and not verification
  evidence: check a claim against the repository before relying on it. It
  names the task's issue. Keep it short and current.
- Review preserves epistemic labels: Decided / Provisional / Open in
  specifications, and verified defect / limitation / hypothesis /
  documentation drift in its findings.
- Docs, tests, and code are three representations of one spec: change them
  together. Mark doc sections Decided / Provisional / Open where a design
  decision actually has that status.
- A check Review keeps missing becomes a repository check; do not add
  mechanical checks by default.
- Check a proposal against the vision first; if existing code conflicts with
  it, say so rather than rationalize it.
- One coherent change per PR. Append an entry to `CHANGES.md` per PR. If two
  open branches both append to `CHANGES.md`, stack the later one on the
  earlier one to avoid conflicts.
- Never edit the owner's tests to fit new code without saying so; if a test
  encodes an old rule, rename it to what it now checks and call it out.
- AI sessions should not limit themselves to the immediate patch when the work
  exposes a concrete architectural or process weakness. Surface the smallest
  justified improvement and explain why it follows from the evidence.
- Distinguish changes required for the current task from useful architectural
  or process follow-ups so scope remains explicit. Non-blocking follow-ups
  stay separate from the current task's defects.

## Conventions

- Commits: one line in smart-commit style: the issue key `GH-<n>` first, then
  a verb (Add / Change / Fix / Remove) and exactly what was done, for example
  `GH-50 Change the workflow to five task roles`. Write `GH-<n>`, not `#<n>`:
  GitHub links both, but git drops a line starting with `#` as a comment
  whenever a message is edited in an editor. No body besides trailers.
- PR descriptions: short, with `Closes #<n>` for each issue the PR completes,
  so that merging closes it. No link to the AI session anywhere: not in PR
  descriptions, issues or commit trailers. If the environment appends a
  session link, remove it.
- Prefer extending the existing workflow (a job, step or dispatch input such
  as `mutation_shards`) over adding workflows or throwaway branches. Remove a
  workflow and its runs once its purpose ends.
- Python, standard library only. Frozen dataclasses for semantic records.
- Around 500 lines is a review threshold for source, test, and configuration
  files, not a hard limit. When a file approaches or exceeds it, consider
  splitting by coherent responsibility or subdomain. Keep it monolithic when
  that is clearer; do not split mechanically just to satisfy a line count.
- Large declarative catalogs should normally separate executable loading and
  validation logic from serialized review data when that reduces churn and
  makes review boundaries clearer. Prefer standard-library-readable formats
  and keep validation fail-closed.

## Testing

- Run the complete local suite with:

      python3 -m unittest discover

- The deterministic test modules are partitioned into semantic lanes defined
  by `tests/lanes.py`. Run one lane with:

      python3 -m tests.lanes <lane>

  CI runs every lane in one job on Python 3.12, each lane as its own process,
  as many at a time as the runner has CPUs, and prints a per-lane result and
  timing table:

      python3 -m tests.lanes --all

- Every ordinary `tests/test_*.py` module must appear in exactly one lane in
  `tests/lanes.py`. Adding a test module without assigning it to a lane, listing
  it twice, or leaving a stale lane entry makes CI fail.
- Every test module ends with `if __name__ == "__main__": unittest.main()`,
  so `python3 -m tests.test_x` runs one module.
- Generated/property tests use deterministic seeds. Shared generated-test
  infrastructure lives in `tests/generation.py`.
- `SHEAR_SEED=<seed>` replays a generated case. A comma-separated list
  replays several explicit seeds. An explicit seed overrides the generated
  case budget.
- `SHEAR_CASES=<n>` changes the deterministic generated-case budget for
  participating tests. Unset, empty, or `0` means use each test's ordinary
  default budget; a positive integer selects the heavy budget.
- Property tests use `random.Random(seed)` with `subTest(seed=...)`, so
  failures are reproducible. No third-party test libraries.
- A new regression test must fail on the old code. For a property test,
  plant a plausible bug and confirm the property catches it.
- Test semantic contracts, not incidental implementation details.
- CI compares the language layer's golden records (corpus programs,
  continuity cases, public names) with the merge base, or on `main` with the
  commit before the push; nothing is stored or re-recorded.
  `python3 -m tests.golden --against main` runs the same check locally. A
  record may change only when Plan declares its ID (`programs/<name>`,
  `continuity/<name>`, `api/<module>`) in a new file
  `tests/golden_changes/GH-<n>.txt` for the task's issue (other names fail);
  earlier files are history and never change. A change to the recorder in
  `tests/golden.py` is declared with `*`, preferably in a branch of its own.
- Mutation testing (`tests/mutation*.py`, catalog in
  `tests/mutation_catalog_data/`): survivors are classified only when
  reviewed as equivalent or intentionally unspecified, and only for the exact
  pinned target-source and engine versions; a test gap gets a regression
  test, never a whitelist entry. Sampling, sharding, reports and replay
  commands: `docs/verification_hardening.md` section 15.

## Model map

- `canonical.py`: canonical content and serialization; identity is derived
  from canonical bytes. `SemanticRecord` lets model records be values.
- `values.py`, `state.py`: `Value`, immutable `State` (values + ownership);
  `StateID` is derived from content and cannot be supplied.
- `transforms.py`: `TransformationDefinition` (changes, mappings, named
  conversions) → `TransformResult`. Mapped sources are removed unless they
  are mapping destinations; changing a removed entity is rejected; relation
  endpoints and ownership follow declared continuity. `rebase` combines
  two results of one state when their `touched` sets are disjoint, else
  `TransformationConflict`.
- `matching.py`: continuity inference for `define` (`match`, `shapes`):
  unique unchanged subtrees keep their identity, largest first, then the
  edited position by kind (docs/continuity_inference.md).
- `relations.py`: `Relation(kind, roles, payload)` entities; endpoints must
  exist; a constraint payload makes a constraint relation. Kinds have no
  core meaning.
- `constraints.py`: three-valued semantic constraints (strong Kleene),
  `Evaluator` behind `External(name)`, step budgets.
- `operations.py`: the one table of operation shapes (arity, code roles,
  ordered roles, positional build); `lang`, `continuity` and `syntax` derive
  from it, and `tests/test_operations.py` checks every implementation agrees.
- `lang.py`, `bytecode.py`, `machine.py`: the language layer. `lang.py` keeps
  code as graph form (`load`, `define`, `function_at`; `define` infers what an
  edit keeps and can create, remove and relink functions); `bytecode.py` lowers
  each node to a chunk, kept with the node's `Value`; `machine.py` runs chunks
  with explicit stacks. Dependencies point one way: machine → bytecode →
  lang, with `lang.run` the one lazy call into the machine.
- `fold.py`: constant folding as a graph transformation that declares its
  merges (`fold_constants`, `sources_of`).
- `continuity.py`: the continuity corpus: cases with expected continuity
  per operation (`CASES`, `check`); a `gap` case would record inference
  still missing; all 21 hold (docs/continuity_corpus.md).
- `examples/ledger.py`: executable measurements for the graph ledger:
  incremental lowering counts, continuity-corpus identity claims and fold
  provenance (`docs/graph_ledger.md`).
- `syntax/`: text syntax version 0 over `lang.py`, split into `lexer`,
  `parser`, `printer` and shared `forms`: `parse` (text to the
  input format, over an optional base), `render` and `render_program` (graph
  form to text, `raw(...)` for what the syntax cannot write). Import-only.
- `reconcile.py`: edited complete source to a graph transformation
  (`reconcile`): parses and resolves the edited program, preserves
  top-level identity for declarations that keep their name, delegates
  code-node continuity to `lang.define`, treats a bare top-level rename as
  remove plus create, and rejects cell declaration edits until migration
  semantics are specified (`docs/name_resolution.md`).
- `cells.py`, `runtime.py`: `CellDeclaration(constraint, initial)`;
  `Runtime` holds cell content outside `StateID`, checks constraints
  (anything but Satisfied rejects), activates transformation results
  atomically (two-version bound, holds, retirement), rebases a result
  from an earlier active state over those activated since, and runs trials.
