# Hosted Bootstrap Boundary

**Status: provisional.** Roadmap task 28, issue #64. This document
records the current operation support boundary and inventories the Python
host services relevant to hosted bootstrap. It does not decide D3 or D4.

Baseline: `main` at `081ba0d0882e9c02906a3f6a4081f77d2907e897`.

## 1. Scope and terminology

The four routes are:

1. Host lowering: graph-form nodes lowered by `shear.bytecode.lower`.
2. Host execution: those chunks executed by `shear.machine`.
3. SHEAR lowering: input-form expressions compiled by the SHEAR
   program `lower` in `shear/examples/self_hosting.py`.
4. SHEAR-VM execution: expanded chunks interpreted by the SHEAR
   program `vm` in `shear/examples/vm.py`.

The fourth route is itself executed on the Python-hosted machine.
The execution columns identify the interpreter implementing an
instruction, not the absence of Python.

For the SHEAR-VM column, support means that the expanded instruction
sequence for the operation is implemented by the interpreter. It does
not mean that a complete valid source expression can necessarily be
compiled and executed through both SHEAR routes. In particular,
`unquote` has instruction-level support for `GOTO`, although valid
source `unquote` occurs only inside `quote`, which the VM lacks.

Status definitions:

- **S – Supported:** the relevant lowering or instruction route
  implements the operation for its valid inputs at the defined level.
- **R – Rejected:** the operation denotes invalid code and fails
  intentionally; lowering may produce an explicit failure instruction.
- **D – Deferred:** the route does not implement the intended operation.
  Its current behavior must fail explicitly instead of succeeding through
  an undeclared alternative execution route.

The matrix describes current code, not the post-task-30 target subset
or proof of an end-to-end bootstrap.

## 2. Operation support matrix

**Provisional:**

These classifications describe current implementation behavior.
Every row corresponds to exactly one operation in
`shear.operations.OPERATIONS`.

| Operation | Host lower | Host run | SHEAR lower | SHEAR VM |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lit` | S | S | S | S |
| `arg` | S | S | S | S |
| `add` | S | S | S | S |
| `sub` | S | S | S | S |
| `mul` | S | S | S | S |
| `lt` | S | S | S | S |
| `eq` | S | S | S | S |
| `if` | S | S | S | S |
| `seq` | S | S | S | S |
| `call` | S | S | S | S |
| `read` | S | S | S | D |
| `write` | S | S | S | D |
| `quote` | S | S | D | D |
| `unquote` | S | S | D | S |
| `function` | S | S | D | D |
| `closure` | S | S | S | S |
| `activate` | S | S | D | D |
| `trial` | S | S | D | D |
| `tuple` | S | S | S | S |
| `len` | S | S | S | S |
| `item` | S | S | S | S |
| `slice` | S | S | S | S |
| `concat` | S | S | S | S |
| `let` | S | S | S | S |
| `catch` | S | S | D | D |
| `raise` | S | S | D | D |
| `ref` | S | S | S | S |
| `code` | S | S | S | D |
| `linksof` | S | S | S | D |
| `apply` | S | S | S | S |
| `applyv` | S | S | S | S |
| `invalid` | R | R | R | R |

`label` is an input form, not an operation in `OPERATIONS`.
SHEAR lowering recognizes it transparently.

### 2.1 Implementation evidence and limitations

Host lowering is implemented by `bytecode.lower`, including
`_lower_activation`. Host execution dispatches in `machine._execute`.
An `invalid` node lowers to `RAISE` and raises a language error when
executed.

SHEAR lowering's supported subset is
`self_hosting.LOWERED - {"label"}`. All other operation names,
including `invalid`, currently produce
`(("RAISE", "unknown operation"), ("END",))`.
This explicitly fails, but does not distinguish rejected from
deferred operations in its diagnostic.

The SHEAR VM recognizes instructions from `vm._ORDER`, implemented
through `vm._cases` and `vm._run_body`. Unsupported instructions
reach `vm_trap`, rather than being run by the host instruction
dispatcher.

Host lowering of `unquote` produces `GOTO`, which the SHEAR VM
implements. That instruction-level S does not imply support for
a complete quote/unquote expression.

`CALL` uses a linked function through host `applyv`. The VM's
`APPLY` and `APPLYV` cases also delegate when the VM callable is a
reference; a VM closure instead enters `vm_run`. Consequently,
instruction coverage does not prove that all reached program code
is interpreted, or that its chunks were SHEAR-compiled.
The transitive execution-route question belongs to task 29.

### 2.2 Existing invariants and bootstrap scope

The semantic graph remains canonical and bytecode remains derived.
The existing identity, continuity, activation, runtime-cell and
execution contracts are specified in `state_model.md`,
`identity_model.md`, `continuity_inference.md`,
`activation_model.md`, and `bytecode.md`. Task 28 does not
redefine or amend them.

**Provisional:**

The intended hosted-bootstrap boundary distinguishes permitted
host services, fixed interpreter machinery, seed compilation,
SHEAR compilation, and executed program code. Unsupported routes
must fail explicitly, not silently switch execution engines.

Task 28 tests the immediate lowering results and interpreter traps.
It does not establish complete producer provenance or the absence
of host compilation anywhere in the transitive execution graph.
That requirement is an explicit task-30 acceptance condition.

## 3. Host-service inventory

**Provisional:**

This is an inventory and a set of proposed allowances for D4,
not an authorization of those services. Each row states its
contract, implementation, proposed use, reported rebuild
observation, and existing verification references.

"Observed" refers to a reviewer's trace of rebuild generations
1 and 2. The trace was reported in review rather than committed
as a repository artifact. To reproduce the lowering observations,
create a fresh `Runtime(load(program(vm.bootstrap_entities())))`,
spy on `bytecode.lower_value` while forwarding to the original
function, and invoke
`run(runtime, vm.SWAP_ALL, may_activate=True)` twice.
Record the `relation_of(value).kind` supplied to each lowering call,
excluding runtime initialization from the recording window.

This observes host lowering of uncached graph nodes, not every
executed instruction or cached chunk. Other service observations
require separate instrumentation. "Yes" and "No" apply only to
the profiled rebuild; "Partial" and "Unverified" preserve uncertainty.

"Allow" is a proposed Python-hosted service. "Conditional"
requires D3/D4 resolution. Host-lowered program wrappers are
reported as current behavior, not approved bootstrap fallback.

### 3.1 Current rebuild versus required hosted pipeline

The reported rebuild profile includes `define`, matching,
activation, version holds and retirement, `cells_of`,
`function_at`, and semantic model services. The host-lowering
trace also reports 16 `code` nodes and 4 `linksof` nodes
across two successive `swap_all` runs.

The review did not observe source parsing, reconciliation,
trials, constraint evaluation, or `read`, `write`, `catch`
and `raise` execution. Absence in this profile is not
proof that these operations are unnecessary for D4.

The host also lowers the wrappers for `evals`, `lower`, `upper`,
and the `generation` function during generation 2, in addition
to the interpreter's own functions. These per-function wrappers
are program code, not automatically exempt fixed machinery under
task 30. The current rebuild therefore must not be described as
already meeting the task-30 no-host-lowering requirement.

Source parsing and reconciliation are prospective dependencies
of task 30. Trial and live-evolution services are prospective
dependencies of task 31. An absent call in the present rebuild
does not establish that a service can be removed from D4.

The reported service observations need independent verification
before being treated as complete execution-provenance evidence.
The selected-route measurements and their limits remain in
`content_baseline.md`.

Python allocation, hashing, memory management and operating-system
services remain part of this hosted model. Python-independent
execution is a separate future milestone.

## 4. Acceptance contract for task 28

**Provisional:**

The Plan-owned acceptance module is
`tests/test_bootstrap_boundary.py`, registered in `tests/lanes.py`.

1. The matrix has exactly one row for each operation in
   `OPERATIONS`, including `invalid`, and the input-only `label`
   is excluded.
2. Host lowering dispatch covers the operation set. Real graph
   witnesses yield chunks ending in `END` whose instructions
   are recognized by the host dispatcher.
3. SHEAR lowering coverage agrees with
   `self_hosting.LOWERED - {"label"}`. Supported examples
   structurally agree with expanded host chunks.
4. SHEAR-VM support is classified from the interpreter's actual
   instruction cases and order. A supported `LIT` example
   executes successfully; this is not an execution witness
   for every supported opcode.
5. Deferred SHEAR lowering produces the explicit
   `RAISE "unknown operation"` result. The test checks that
   result, not global absence of Python host fallback.
6. Unsupported SHEAR-VM instructions reach `vm_trap`.
   An observable replacement trap and the ordinary failing
   trap verify the route independently of the host opcode
   dispatcher.
7. The invalid graph-form witness lowers to `RAISE`
   and host execution reports its specific unknown-operation
   error. SHEAR lowering currently gives `invalid` the same
   generic error chunk as deferred operations.
8. Each inventory row identifies a contract, implementation,
   allowance, reported use and test reference. The automated
   check verifies structure and the existence of named test
   modules; it does not verify that each implementation
   reference is a real symbol or that every proposed service
   is exercised by those tests.

The existing `tests/test_rebuild.py` separately checks that
generations 2 and 3 do not request host `chunk_of` for the
retained compiler source twins. Its instrumentation does not
cover all host-lowered wrappers or transitive execution.

`CALL`, `APPLY` and `APPLYV` delegation is recorded in section
2.1 as a current limitation. Task 29 must test the proposed
execution routes and their transitive program-code behavior.

Preserve existing compiler, VM, corpus, continuity and golden
records. No golden-record changes are intended for issue #64.

## 5. Scope and decision gates

Task 28 records the matrix, its acceptance tests and the host
inventory. It does not implement additional instructions or
change production semantics.

**Open:**

D3 and D4 remain owner decisions as defined in `roadmap.md`,
under "Pending decisions" and section I. This document does not
restate or supersede their choices and requirements.

In particular, D4 sets provisional budgets for both compiler
rebuild time and small-edit-to-activation latency using task-23
measurements. The permitted Python services include
canonicalization, subject to D3/D4 approval.

Tasks 29 through 31 own execution-route evaluation, complete
pipeline provenance and live evolution respectively. No
implementation may treat this inventory as a prior decision
to permit fallback for executed program code.

## 6. Independent review targets

Independently verify the operation classifications, especially
`invalid`, `unquote`, the deferred instructions, and the
instruction-level meaning of VM support.

Check that tests distinguish declared behavior from untested
claims, that malformed witnesses are not mistaken for operation
support, and that error paths fail explicitly.

Inspect `CALL`, `APPLY` and `APPLYV` delegation and reported
host-lowered wrappers when assessing the future D3/D4 boundary.
The service-use observations must not be promoted to complete
producer-provenance evidence without an independent trace.

Compare the Plan-owned specification and acceptance tests with
the revised Plan baseline before accepting subsequent changes.

The matrix and inventory are inputs to D4 and task 29, not
evidence that hosted bootstrap is complete.
