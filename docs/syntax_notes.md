# Syntax and Tooling Notes

Status: exploratory design notes by the owner, not a language decision.
The first syntax built from them is specified in syntax.md.

# Core Principle

SHEAR should have multiple representations of the same program.

No single representation should be forced to serve simultaneously as:

- human source language
- semantic representation
- executable IR

Instead:

```text
Human Source
      ⇅
Semantic Graph
      ⇅
Executable IR
```

The semantic graph remains authoritative.

Source and IR are projections.

---

# Representation Layers

## Human Source

Optimized for:

- readability
- writing
- code review
- learning
- maintenance

Example:

```text
fn square(x):
    x * x
```

---

## Semantic Representation

Optimized for:

- transformations
- validation
- graph operations
- persistence
- versioning

Example:

```text
Function
  params:
    x

  body:
    mul
      arg(x)
      arg(x)
```

or

```text
(
    "function",
    ("x",),
    (
        "mul",
        ("arg", 0),
        ("arg", 0),
    ),
)
```

This layer contains:

- EntityID
- VersionID
- links
- constraints
- ownership
- metadata

and is the source of truth.

---

## Executable IR

Optimized for:

- optimization
- compilation
- JIT
- code generation

Possible forms:

- SHEAR IR
- MLIR
- LLVM IR
- WASM IR

Example:

```text
%0 = load_arg 0
%1 = load_arg 0
%2 = mul %0 %1
return %2
```

---

# Syntax Direction A

Readable Function-Oriented Syntax

Example:

```text
fn increment(step):
    counter = counter + step
```

---

Example:

```text
fn fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        n
    else:
        fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

---

Advantages

- familiar
- concise
- easy to teach
- easy to review

Disadvantages

- hides semantic graph structure
- requires parser

---

# Syntax Direction B

Graph-Oriented Syntax

Example:

```text
function increment:
    params:
        step

    body:
        add(
            read(counter),
            step
        )
```

or

```text
function increment:
    step

    write counter:
        add(
            read(counter),
            step
        )
```

---

Advantages

- closer to semantic graph
- simpler parser

Disadvantages

- verbose
- less pleasant for humans

---

# Preferred Direction

Human source should prioritize readability.

Graph structure should be visible in editor tooling rather than source syntax.

---

# Quote / Unquote

Goal:

Code should be editable as code.

Not as nested tuples.

Preferred:

```text
quote:
    x * unquote emit(n - 1)
```

Alternative:

```text
quote {
    x * unquote emit(n - 1)
}
```

Avoid:

```text
("quote", ...)
```

in source syntax.

---

# Function Values

Declaration:

```text
fn square(x):
    x * x
```

Anonymous function:

```text
fn(x):
    x * x
```

Both produce Function values.

---

# Activation

Current semantic form:

```text
activate(...)
```

Human form:

```text
activate:
    power = fn(x):
        emit(n)
```

Possible multiple activations:

```text
activate:
    power = new_power
    helper = new_helper
```

Activation remains atomic.

---

# Links

Human source should not normally expose links.

Example:

```text
fn increment(step):
    counter = counter + step
```

implicitly creates a link to counter.

Semantic graph stores the actual relation.

---

# Variables

Source:

```text
counter
```

means read.

Source:

```text
counter = counter + 1
```

means write.

Human syntax should not expose:

```text
read(counter)
write(counter)
```

except possibly in advanced tooling.

---

# Sequencing

Avoid:

```text
seq(...)
```

Human syntax:

```text
fn bump():
    counter = counter + 1
    counter
```

Last expression returns.

---

# Tooling Vision

Editor operates on semantic graph.

Source editor is only one view.

---

Possible Views

## Source View

```text
fn square(x):
    x * x
```

---

## Semantic View

```text
Function
  EntityID: E42
  VersionID: V17

  params:
    x

  body:
    mul
      arg(x)
      arg(x)
```

---

## Graph View

```text
square
   │
   ▼
  mul
 /   \
x     x
```

---

## Executable IR View

```text
ARG 0
ARG 0
MUL
RET
```

or MLIR.

---

# MLIR Integration

Possible architecture:

```text
Semantic Graph
        ↓
SHEAR MLIR Dialect
        ↓
Standard MLIR
        ↓
LLVM Dialect
        ↓
LLVM IR
```

Possible SHEAR dialect operations:

```text
shear.entity
shear.relation
shear.function
shear.cell
shear.read
shear.write
shear.activate
shear.constraint
```

---

# LLVM / MLIR Position

LLVM and MLIR are compiler backends.

They are not the semantic model.

The semantic graph remains authoritative.

---

# Future Multi-View Workflow

```text
             Semantic Graph
                    │
      ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
      ▼             ▼             ▼

  Source View   Graph View   IR View
```

All views edit the same semantic object.

Changes produce a new semantic version.

---

# Long-Term Goal

A function, relation, data structure, transformation, module, or entire program can be viewed and edited as:

- human source
- semantic graph
- executable IR

without changing its identity.

The semantic graph is primary.

Everything else is a projection.
