"""Runtime state: loaded versions, mutable cell content, and holds.

Program states are immutable semantic values. A ``Runtime`` is the mutable
runtime state of one running program: the content of its mutable cells and
the record of what depends on which loaded version.

Ownership follows activation_model.md section 7: the runtime root owns the
loaded versions, and each version owns the content of its cells. Holds record
that running code or runtime-held references depend on a version.

Cell content must satisfy the cell's constraint. A runtime checks the initial
content of every cell when it loads a version, and checks every write, using
its evaluation context. Only ``SATISFIED`` is accepted: ``VIOLATED`` and
``UNKNOWN`` are both rejected.

Activation (activation_model.md) switches the runtime to the destination of a
transformation result. Everything is staged first and the switch is atomic:
a rejected activation leaves the runtime unchanged.
