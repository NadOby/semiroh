"""The mechanical shape of each graph-form operation (graph_form.md §3).

One table says, per node kind, how many input-form operands it takes, which
roles hold code and in which input order, and which of those roles hold an
ordered tuple of nodes. ``lang`` (building and collapsing graph form),
``continuity`` (operand paths) and ``syntax`` (builtin arity) read it instead
of keeping their own copies. What an operation *means* (how it is parsed,
lowered, run or compiled by the self-hosted compiler) stays explicit in each
of those modules.

A *positional* operation is pure structure: no payload and no link, and its
input operands are its code roles in order, the last one taking every
remaining operand when it is ordered. ``lang`` builds and collapses those
generically; every other operation has its own case there.
