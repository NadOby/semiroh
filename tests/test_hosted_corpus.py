"""Plan-owned Task 30 hosted-corpus acceptance tests.

See docs/hosted_pipeline.md and issue #66.

These tests deliberately fail before the hosted pipeline exists.
Do not skip missing implementation or fall back to lang.run.

HostedSession is the provisional public test boundary:
    HostedSession(runtime)
    prepare(compiler_generation=1)
    run(entry, *args, may_activate=False)
    trace() -> immutable sequence of provenance events

Each event exposes kind, route, entity, version and artifact_id.
Production events additionally identify the compiler generation.

The tests use the existing corpus expectations as independent
behavioral oracles.
